WINNING IN THE AGE OF THE CUSTOMER

Internet Week Denmark 2016 mini-conference

# 

OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

Today, companies operate in 'The age of the customer', a market characterized by 2 paramount tendencies:

1. Digital technologies affect all communication, value creation and all transactions

2. Customers know everything, evaluate everything and demand communication, products and services tailored for their individual needs

This places entirely new demands on businesses' customer insights, technologies and agility in marketing, sales, customer services and business development.

approaches and strategies

for the age of the customer. You will meet experienced and passionate digital business developers, marketers and analysts, each presenting their best answer to the question: 

How can a business win in the age of the customer?

# 

TARGET AUDIENCES
